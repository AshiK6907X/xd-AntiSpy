# xd-AntiSpy
Here is a small project I worked on for a client who, unfortunatelyâ€”or maybe fortunatelyâ€”switched to Linux. Now, I can release it publicly. I took another look at it and tweaked a few business features for private users, some of which even come from Winpilot. Other than that, this program has nothing in common with my other small apps under the hood, as it was designed with a focus on durability and longevity.

The original and my fork were initially written in C++. For the relaunch, I've rewritten it in C#. The app looks exactly like the original and does the same thing, but now it's for Windows 11. It was and is a relaunch of the [legendary little helper, XP-Antispy](https://xp-antispy.org/en/), which was indispensable under Windows XP. Does anyone know what happened to the developer Chris from back then?

The "XP" in the name has now become a smiley "XD", which stands for eXtreme Defense, though it also carries the playful connotation of the ðŸ˜† smiley. The app continues the versioning from where the original left off, at version 3.98. If you're interested, feel free to try it out, share it, and I'll be ready to release the code soon.
