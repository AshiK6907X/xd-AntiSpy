# xd-AntiSpy

Here is a small project that I had in use with a client who has now, fortunately or unfortunately, switched to Linux. As a result, I am now able to release it. I've revisited the project and added a few business features tailored for private users.

The original version and my fork were originally written in C++. For this relaunch, I've rewritten it in C#. The app looks and functions exactly like the original, but now it's designed for Windows 11. It was and remains a relaunch of the [legendary little helper, XP-Antispy](https://xp-antispy.org/en/), which was indispensable back in the Windows XP days.
Does anyone know what happened to the developer Chris from back then? The "XP" in the name has now been replaced with an "XD" smiley, which stands for eXtreme Defense, though it also carries the playful connotation of the ðŸ˜† smiley. The app continues its versioning where the original left off, at version 3.98. If anyone is interested, feel free to try it out and share it. I am also willing to release the code soon.
