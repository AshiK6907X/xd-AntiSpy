# xd-AntiSpy

Here's a small project I had deployed at a client's, who has now, unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately - switched to Linux, allowing me to finally release it. It was and remains a relaunch of the legendary little helper XP-Antispy, essential back in the Windows XP days. The original and my fork were originally written in C++, but I've now rewritten the relaunch in C#. The app looks exactly like the original and does the same thing, but now for Windows 11. Does anyone actually know what happened to the developer Chris from back then? 

The XP in the name has now become XD, which stands for eXtreme Defense, though it also carries the playful connotation of the ðŸ˜† smiley. The app continues versioning from where the original left off, namely at 3.98. If anyone is interested, feel free to try it out, share it around, and I'm ready to release the code soon as well.
